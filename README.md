mood.html lets you select a mood.
entry.html is for journal entries.
focusTimerPage.html includes a timer to track focus sessions.
analytics.html displays charts and stats using Chart.js.
favoritesPage.html shows starred (favorite) entries.
LocalStorage Data

Moodster saves all user data (moods, journals, focus time, favorites) in your browser’s LocalStorage.
